Programs for my ComputerCraft turtles

First, grab the github program for your computer by running this on your cc computer: 
```
pastebin get jCQg9nEq github
```

Then you can pull down programs from github like this: 
```
--github USER REPO SOURCE DEST 
github rswhiting ComputerCraft update update
```

For more info on how the other programs work check out the wiki:

Alternately, grab the github program with defaults (beta, paste available until May 4):
```
pastebin get 7kSExRpP github
```
